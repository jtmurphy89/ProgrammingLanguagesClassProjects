// This concludes the introduction to Scala for CS162.  You've covered
// a lot of ground in a short time, but you've really only scratched the
// surface of what Scala has to offer.  For the most part, we assume
// of you only what was covered in this tutorial.  That said, there
// are many places that if you go look at the APIs online, you'll
// find a nice method that does something that you want already.
// A large part of writing short, idiomatic Scala code is in taking
// advantage of what the library writers provide, and it's simply
// not possible to go over all that content in a minimalistic tutorial.

// Don't be afraid to Google around for help.  Of specific importance
// are the objects themselves.  For example, if you have a `Map` and you're
// stuck, then Googling for `scala Map` will give you the Scala standard
// library definition for `Map`, which includes all the methods defined
// on `Map` along with their signatures.  Because Scala is purely
// object-oriented, it must be the case that all Scala library code is
// defined in a class somewhere in the standard library.
